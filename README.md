# Application Load Balancer 

This folder contains an example [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) configuration that defines a module for 
deploying a load balancer (using [ELB](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/)) in an 
[Amazon Web Services (AWS) account](http://aws.amazon.com/).

## Quick start

Terraform modules are not meant to be deployed directly. Instead, you should be including them in other Terraform 
configurations. See [smithlabs/hello-world-terraform-go-demo](https://github.com/smithlabs/hello-world-terraform-go-demo)
for examples.
